# Lab Meetings QuantGen Group Spring 2016

[Group's Website](http://quantgen.github.io/)

This semester we will be covering  papers from outside the group, a few presentations on ongoing research from our group and have a vew invited presenters.

**Advisors**: Each of the students presenting must pick an advisor, possible advisors are: Sudha, Hwasoon, Ana and Gustavo.

**Papers**: Choose one paper from the list below or propose one. Papers should: (a) introduce novel methodology that is relevant to the research interests of the group, or (b) be relevant to the particular applications you are working on.
