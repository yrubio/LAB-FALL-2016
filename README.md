# Lab Meetings QuantGen Group Spring 2016

[Group's Website](http://quantgen.github.io/)

This season we will be covering papers from outside the group (~8), software from the group (1-2) and eventually discussion of grant proposals.

Papers: choose one paper from the list below or propose one. Papers should: (a) introduce novel methodology that is relevant to the research interests of the group, or (b) be relevant to the particular applications you are working on. 

Software: we will organize 1-2 sections to share software being developed by the group. 

Grant proposals: if time permits we will include a section on grant writing (format to be determined).
